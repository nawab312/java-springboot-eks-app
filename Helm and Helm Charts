1. What is Helm
Helm is a tool for Kubernetes that helps you install and manage applications, which means like in RedHat and Ubuntu operating systems we see Yum and apt package manager to install any software or to delete or to manage software inside the operating system. Same way. Helm is also specially designed for the Kubernetes cluster or Kubernetes infrastructure.
What are the advantages of Helm?
Basically we use helm for the repetitive tasks and we can do application deployment easy standardized and it can be reusable, which means let's take an example.
For example, if we want to deploy an application, we need many components like pods, secrets, jobs, volumes. Config maps cetera. So if you don't have helm then we need to create each individual yaml file for each resource and we need to execute them with the help of kubectl command. And managing these resources with the kubectl will be tough.
So instead of that, if we use helm, then we can package all together and we can create it as a helm chart so that the deployment will be very easy and we can maintain the versions of the charts and many things we can do.

2. Helm Architecture
So let's see how helm three will work with the Kubernetes. We are going to install Helm inside the Jenkins server. 
Why? Because what Jenkins will do in the job whenever the code is ready, it will pull the code from the GitHub repository. 
With the help of Maven it will build the code and it will create a Docker image and the Docker image will be stored inside the Docker registry. 
Once it is done, the job will be completed and whenever we want to deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster, then it should configure it as a CD job. 
So whenever we want to deploy from Jenkins to Kubernetes cluster, we use Helm to deploy the applications.
So that's the reason we configure helm inside the Jenkins and in the CD job, it is going to execute
